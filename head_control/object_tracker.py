"""
ObjectTracker — object-level temporal fusion (inspired by a colleague's PCL
tabletop node) adapted for our cylinder + colour scenario.

WHY object-level (not point-level) fusion:
    Our earlier voxel-map fusion failed: stacking raw points from different head
    poses accumulated depth noise + sub-degree extrinsic error into a smeared
    blob ("layered heights", NO TABLE). Fusing at the OBJECT level avoids this
    entirely — each frame yields an independent, clean detection and we only
    combine the DERIVED quantities. No point registration => no error stacking
    => works even while the head moves.

KEY MECHANISMS (borrowed + adapted):
    * Nearest-neighbour matching (2D, within TRACK_MATCH_DIST) gives each object
      a stable identity across frames.
    * EMA-smoothed dimensions (radius, height) — see the 2026-07-02 note below.
    * Cumulative arc coverage: we OR the observed angular sectors across frames,
      so coverage (and hence confidence) climbs toward 100% as more of the
      object is seen from different viewpoints — the honest multi-view gain.
    * Persistence: an unmatched object survives TRACK_MAX_UNSEEN frames before
      deletion, so brief occlusions/dropouts don't make it flicker.

    Position is EMA-smoothed (stable) rather than grow-only — averaging
    viewpoints with opposite-sign partial-view bias actually reduces net bias.

DIMENSION FUSION POLICY — CHANGED 2026-07-02 (accuracy pass):
    Previously radius/height used a GROW-ONLY rule ("a partial view can only
    ever make the estimate bigger, never smaller") with a slow decay. That
    rule was a reasonable patch AS LONG AS the per-frame estimator was known
    to be systematically biased SMALL (the old Kasa-on-the-whole-cluster fit
    was: ~ -3 to -5mm on radius, verified numerically). Grow-only was, in
    effect, quietly correcting for that one-directional bias.

    The per-frame estimator in object_detector.py no longer has that bias
    (rim extraction + Hyper fit; height now a top-slice median, not z_max —
    see its module docstring). Grow-only on a now-UNBIASED, noisy signal is
    the wrong fusion rule: it keeps taking the running max of a symmetric-
    noise signal, which drifts systematically upward over many frames
    (verified numerically: +0.5 to +0.9mm bias after just 5-50 frames, then
    keeps climbing on a longer scan) — an over-estimate this task did not
    have before, and does not need. A standard EMA (TRACK_POS_ALPHA, same
    smoothing already used for position) is the correct fusion rule for a
    now-unbiased per-frame signal: verified numerically to stay within
    ~0.01mm of the true value regardless of how many frames are fused,
    while still averaging out per-frame noise (its RMS scales down with
    more frames, same as position).
